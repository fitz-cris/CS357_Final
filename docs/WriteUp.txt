CS 357 Final Project Cris Fitzgerald

This project was a blast to complete. While challenging, I had fun creating it. 
The physical product has 5 main components:
- Xinda IR remote and reciever
- Servo Motor
- LCD display
- Arduino Nano
- Red and Green LEDs

Originally I had planned to make the LEDS just one RGB LED that changed colors depending on 
whether or not the input combination was correct, but the RGB LED needed 3 PWM output pins
on the nano, and between the LCD and the Servo, I only had two to spare. I also originally
wanted to mount the remote on the side of the safe like an atm, but you couldnt generate
enough force to press the button without ripping it out of its housing. Better materials 
would solve this problem. As it is, the remote will sometimes enter two of a number if you 
hold the button down too long, and finding the right balance is a bit tough.

The phsyical safe construction, while shoddy, is a proof of concept made of an old cardboard
box, some hot glue, and staples. The actual lock mechanism is made with a bent paper clip
hot glued to a popsicle stick, so that the servo motor can retract it.

I created a library for the actual lock class itself so that the sensitive combination data 
wouldnt be exposed to the other code.

I would like to thank my dog, Mucha, for staying up late with me while I was bug fixing.
